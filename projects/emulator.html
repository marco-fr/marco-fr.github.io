        <h1>6502 Emulator</h1>
        <div class="info">
            The 6502 is a processor from the 1980s. There is not really a use for writing an emulator
            like I did by itself because a CPU can't do much alone. Without also emulating graphics, input and
            many other things, I essentially have an annoying way to execute assembly code. I did this in the
            hopes that I would learn 6502 assembly, but I found out that just because I know all the instructions
            doesn't mean I can use them effectively.
            <h3>Registers</h3>
            The processor has 6 registers. They are the stack pointer, program counter, processor status, X, Y and accumulator.
            The stack pointer is one byte since it only addresses from 0x0100 to 0x01FF. The stack is not actually on the
            first byte worth of memory addresses. The first portion of memory is
            for the zero page. These addresses are accessed with special opcodes because they can be referenced using one byte,
            so they are faster and take fewer cycles. The stack is right above the zero page. The program counter is two bytes
            since it needs to point to all possible addresses on the machine. It has 16 bits which makes the 6502 a 16 bit processor.
            The X, Y and accumulator are used for loading, storing and other general uses.
